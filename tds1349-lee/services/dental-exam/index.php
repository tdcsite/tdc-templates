					<h2 class="article-title">Dental Cleanings in <?php echo $city ?></h2>
					<p>The American Dental Association (ADA) recommends that patients visit a dentist twice every year. Most insurances will cover two visits as a result of this recommendation. This is because traditional brushing methods are unable to remove tartar, though plaque prevention is still possible.Â 
					</p>

					<p> A dental cleaning will remove bacteria, tartar buildup, and plaque from the surface of your teeth. This is vital to ensure that your teeth stay in great health. <br><br> In addition, your dental cleaning includes a polishing that will give your teeth a nice shine!!</p>

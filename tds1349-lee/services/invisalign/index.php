					<p>Many people are dissatisfied with the appearance of their smile, sometimes because of crooked teeth or malocclusion. With advances in dental technologies, it is now possible to straighten your teeth discreetly without the use of traditional metal braces and wires.</p>
					
					<h3>Benefits of Invisalign</h3>
					
					<p>Invisalign has become increasingly popular in recent years for several reasons, including:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Discrete way to improve your smile without anyone knowing </li>
						
						<li>Removable aligners - so you can maintain your diet and dental cleaning routine </li>
						
						<li>Fewer visits to the dentist - dental visits are placed at 6-8 week intervals to assess the progress of the treatment and to receive your next 3-4 sets of aligners </li>
						
					</ul>

					<h3>How Invisalign works</h3>
					<p>The Invisalign system requires you to wear a series of custom-made trays fabricated from smooth, translucent material that is specially made for wear over teeth. Each set of aligners moves your teeth incrementally for a period of two weeks, and is replaced by the next set of trays in the series until the completion of your treatment in 6 to 18 months depending on your case.</p>

					<h2>Invisalign For Teens and Invisalign For Adults in <?php echo $city?></h2>
					<p>If you’re a suitable candidate for Invisalign, we will take detailed photos of your teeth and mouth, as well as your bite. X-rays may also be used to create a digital roadmap of your custom treatment. The Invisalign software is used to predict how your teeth will be moved over time until they reach the desired position. You can even view the results to expect at any point in the course of the treatment, as well as the final result. Your series of custom aligners will then be fabricated to facilitate the movement of your teeth. </p>
